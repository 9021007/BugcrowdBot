-# *The server is better for everyone if we all abide by the following rules:*
> __**Rule 1: Comply with the law:**__ __Do not break, or ask anyone to break, the law. No exceptions.__
> 
> **Rule 2: Be respectful and inclusive:** Treat everyone with respect and kindness, regardless of background or experience. We all have a lot to learn from each other—encourage diverse perspectives and foster a culture of shared learning.
> 
> **Rule 3: Remain professional:** Constructive discussions are always welcome and encouraged, but personal attacks or offensive language are not acceptable. This also applies to divisive topics. If you wouldn't say it in a real office, don't say it here. 
> 
> **Rule 4: Maintain confidentiality:** Do not name submission targets or program names for private programs, and never give direct vulnerability information before coordinated public disclosure.
> 
> **Rule 5: Be accountable:** If you make a mistake, acknowledge it, and work towards resolving the issue in a transparent manner. We’re all human after all, and mistakes can be a great learning experience for everyone.
> 
> **Rule 6: No spam:** Do not mass-DM users, especially for advertising.
> 
> **Rule 7: Have fun!** This server is a dedicated place to talk shop, but it’s also a place to send memes, share funny stories, and talk about the horrors of deep dish pizza. Keep it cool, and everyone will have a good time!
